# Attempt to Recognize faces of friends
using convolutional Deep learning to recognize the faces of Me Anish and sir Chaitu
## Vision before attempt

The plan is to sit and make a Neural Network that seperates the faces of friends

Detail is given in the python notebook properly

## Vision after attempt

Satisfied with the work and everything is well documented in the ipynb notebook
achieved a 99.70% accuracy with the model
Now I plan to go work on some problems in Kaggle competions for AI
